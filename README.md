# Self-assembly Monte Carlo reveals localized entanglement in giant polymer melts

This is a repository for the article 'Emergence of giant chains in ring-linear polymer blends via efficient self-assembly Monte Carlo'. The repository is organised as follows: The folders Figure_1, Figure_2, Figure_3, Figure_4, Figure_5 and Figure_6 contain the data plotted in the corresponding figures in the manuscript, as well as some Jupyter notebooks used to generate all the images. The 'Figures_SI' folder contains the data and code for the plots in the Supplementary Information.

The code has been commented using generative AI.
